    1. What is Semantic HTML?
        They are tags that give meaning to our code.
    2. What is HTML used for?
        It's to create the foundation, layout, and or framework of our webpage
    3. What is an attribute and where do we put it? 
        They are additional information for the HTML tags. They can go inside the opening tag or in CSS
    4. What is the h1 tag used for? How many times should I use it on a page?
        <h1> is the main header tag. It's used for the main title, so we should only use it once.
    5. Name two tags that have required attributes
        <a> requires at least the href="" attribute. <img> requires the src="" attribute.
    6. What do we put in the head of our HTML document? 
        The title of the webpage <title>, any relevant meta data <meta>, and links to external javascript or css pages <link>
    7. What is an id? 
        It is a very specific selector, as each id used must be uniquely named, as oppossed to class or element selectors
    8. What elements can I add an id to? 
        Literally any HTML element, even the <body> tag, though I'm not sure why one would need to.
    9. How many times can I use the same id on a page? 
        Only once. But that never stopped me from making the following id's before: id="div001", id="div002", etc
    10. What is a class? 
        It's an attribute that calls the specified CSS dot-method it's named for. <h1 class="bigNblue"> calls the .bigNblue {} method.
    11. What elements can I add a class to? 
        Classes can be added to any element.
    12. How many times can I use the same class on a page? 
        As many times, as long as the class is relevant. A p.doStuff {} class won't work on a <h1> tag.
    13. How do I get my link to open in a new tab?
        Include the appropriate target: <a href="https://www.insert/path/here.com" target="_blank">
    14. What is the alt attribute in the image tag used for? 
        In the event the image doesn't show, the text in the alt attribute will show instead and give a description.
    15. How do I reference an id?
        In CSS, you would use the '#'. So <section id="boldestOne"> is referenced by #boldestOne {}
    16. What is the difference between a section and a div
        <section> is semantic HTML, and <div> is not, but it's used to help structure a desired page layout
    17. What is CSS used for? 
        To style various sections of a page and the elements therein a speficied way: fonts, colors, sizes, etc
    18. How to we select an element? Example - every h2 on the page
        Unlike classes and id's, no prefixing symbol is needed in CSS. So for the above question, use h2 {}
    19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one
        Classes can be used in multiple elements (so as to design those elements all the same way).
        ID's are for singular elements, usually used to anchor parts of a page.
        Example: class
        <section class="prettiness">
        .prettiness {
            color: pink;
            background-color: magenta;
            font-family: "Lucida Calligraphy";
            font-weight: bold;
        }

        Example: ID
        <section id="firstStopOnRoute">
        <a href="#firstStopOnRoute"> -- This link will look for the above ID
            or
        #firstStopOnRoute {
            color: gold;
        }
    20. How do we select classes in CSS?
        Classes in CSS are preceded by a dot. Example: <p class="diddy"> calls .diddy {} in CSS
    21. How do we select a p element with a single class of “human””?
        I assume this question implies the p element is nested within another element with a class of "human". So it would be .human p {}
    22. What is a parent child selector? When would this be useful? 
        A parent child selector is a nested selector in CSS. Like .human p {} example above. It's useful if you don't want to target all of a certain element, like all <p>'s
    23. How do you select all links within a div with the class of sidebar?
        Again, I presume several elements have class="sidebar" but we only want the div. We would use div.sidebar {}
    24. What is a pseudo selector?
        Psuedo selectors use specific words following the CSS selector that would only be called during a given state.
        Examples: a:hover {} -- the "hover" is a pseudo selector activated when the mouse is hovering over a link.
        a:visited {}
        section:last-child {} -- are some more examples
    25. What do we use the change the spacing between lines?
        inside the {} in CSS, we'd use line-height: x; where x > 1 to increase the line-height. Example: line-height: 1.65; or line-height: 2.17;
    26. What do we use to change the spacing between letters?
        inside the {} in CSS, use letter-spacing: #px; Example: letter-spacing: 14px;
    27. What do we use to to change everything to CAPITALS? lowercase? Capitalize?
        inside the {} in CSS, use text-transform: uppercase; text-transform: lowercase; text-transform: capitalize; respectively.
    28. How do I add a 1px border around my div that is dotted and black?
        {
            border-width: 1px;
            border-style: dotted;
            border-color: black;
        }
    29. How do I select everything on the page? 
        use body {} in CSS
    30. How do I write a comment in CSS?
        //for single-line comments,
        and
        /* for
           block
           aka
           (multi-line)
           comments */
    31. How do I find out what file I am in, when I am using the command line? 
        I assume by "file," you mean directory. code fileName.ext
    32. Using the command line - how do I see a list of files/folders in my current folder?
        ls
    33. How do I remove a file via the command line? Why do I have to be careful with this? 
        rm fileName.ext -- Care is needed since no warnings given and it's irreversible
    34. Why should I use version control? 
        It allows you to go back to a previous working version in case you need to without saving countless new versions yourself on your computer
    35. How often should I commit to github?
        Whenever you complete any significant change, but at least every 20 minutes.
    36. What is the command we would use to push our repo up to github? 

    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow.
